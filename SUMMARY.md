**Crack Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for instance segmentation tasks. It is used in the industrial domain. 

The dataset consists of 11298 images with 9844 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Images in the Crack Segmentation Dataset dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. There are 1454 (13% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (1695 images) and *train* (9603 images). The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
