**Crack Segmentation Dataset** is a dataset for a semantic segmentation task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the utilities industry. The dataset presented here is not the original one. Learn more on the dataset's [homepage](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshaymiddha/crack-segmentation-dataset).



The dataset consists of 11298 images with 9844 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*crack*).

Images in the Crack Segmentation Dataset dataset have pixel-level semantic segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the semantic segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into an object detection (bounding boxes for every object) task. There are 1454 (13% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (1695 images) and *train* (9603 images). The original dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
